I'm karx, a computer sciecne student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am a programmer, Linux enthusiast, and a rustlang enjoyer.

I believe in gracious professionalism, [the small web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/), and free software. I believe technology and education should be open to anyone, anywhere.

These days I mainly code in Rust, although I have been using Java for use in the FIRST Tech Challenge.
