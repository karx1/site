Hi! I'm karx, a computer science student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am a programmer, Linux enthusiast, and a rustlang enjoyer.

I believe in gracious professionalism, [the small web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/), and free software. I believe technology and education should be open to anyone, anywhere.

These days I mainly code in Rust, although I have been using Java for use in the FIRST Tech Challenge.

### About This Site

This site was created with a static site generator called [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and it is hosted on Oracle Cloud's free tier. I used to host it on my own server, but since I'm in college now I had to shut off my network. 

The site aims to be readable and usable even without JavaScript. The only JavaScript that I used is the [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) framework that I use for blog comments, and Fireship's [flamethrower router](https://github.com/fireship-io/flamethrower). Even without these, though, the site can still be used, so feel free to disable JavaScript on my website.
