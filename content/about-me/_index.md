Hi! I'm Yash Karandikar, a computer science student. I enjoy writing code, building robots, playing video games, and listening to music.

These days I mainly code in Rust, although I have been using C and Java in my university classes.

Currently, I'm:

- Pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. <a style="color: inherit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_%27em_Horns">🤘</a>
- About to start an internship at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) in the summer
- Trying to discover as much new music as I can (recently I've been getting into Daft Punk)
- Enjoying life!

### About This Site

This site was created with a static site generator called [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and it is hosted on Oracle Cloud's free tier. I used to host it on my own server, but since I'm in college now I had to shut off my network.

The site aims to be readable and usable even without JavaScript. The only JavaScript that I used is the [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) framework that I use for blog comments, Fireship's [flamethrower router](https://github.com/fireship-io/flamethrower), and a script on the homepage to hide my email from bots. Even without these, though, the site can still be used, so feel free to disable JavaScript on my website.
