I'm karx, a student from Texas, USA. I am a programmer, linux enthusiast, and a doctor who fan.

I became interested in technology through the FIRST Lego League competition, part of the FIRST organization which has had a huge impact on my life and my beliefs.

I believe in gracious professionalism, [the small web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/). I believe technology and education should be open to anyone, anywhere.

These days I mainly code in Rust, although I have been using Java for use in the FIRST Tech Challenge. I also use a little bit of C++ for Arduino projects.
