`sandwich` is a funny programming language written in Rust.

*"Why's it called sandwich?"*

*"Well, Rust's logo is a crab, right? And crabs live on beaches. Beaches have sand. A program is just a bunch of bytes one after another. So what do you bite that's related to sand? A sandwich!"*


## Example

```sandwich
lhHello
lwWorld
# prints hello world
p$h, $w!
```
